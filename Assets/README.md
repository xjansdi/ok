This is where the assets should be stored, Pizza Tower Assets, etc.

The assets folder have to be stored like this
```
Assets/music
Assets/sfx
Assets/modname/music
Assets/modname/sfx
```

To extract Pizza Tower Assets, you'll have to use the [Unofficial FMOD Banks Tool](https://gamebanana.com/tools/12100)
([or you can grab the compressed version of the assets here instead](https://mega.nz/file/gQwDULaJ#rdS4_qkBaTA7i9y87lAO4z3ZJBi0MvlG5jz5-sf_o4M))

Put it into the repository Assets folder, and you should be good to go to open this with FMOD Studio!
